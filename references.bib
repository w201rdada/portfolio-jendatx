	abstract = {The Ring GINA platform is capable of sensing and interpreting a user's hand and finger movements to emulate and enhance the functions of classic input methods to smartphones, tablets, and heads-up displays. A wearable platform frees the user from the need to know hand position relative to a keyboard or touchscreen, and grants the ability to perform gestures in open space or on any surface. Here, a method is presented that utilizes these rings as a text input system. In moving forward, efforts are being focused on creating a library of gestures to perform additional tasks, as well as further miniaturizing the mote and ring.},
