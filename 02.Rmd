## Self-Driving Cars alongside Self-Sensing Intersections

Self-driving cars are the future. And that's great. When cars can keep each other informed of which resources are needed and when, we'll all be better off.

But mixed-mode transit is also here to stay. I've no doubt that cars, buses, and trains will find ways to co-exist in the connected future. We shouldn't, however, rely entirely on vehicles arranging traffic in an amongst themselves entirely. We can't expect cyclists, pedestrians, strollers, wheelchairs, inline-skaters, cross-country skiers, and others to purchase (and constantly carry) devices designed to connect with other people's modes of transit.
