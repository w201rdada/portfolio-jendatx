	abstract = {Behavioral choices -- such as speeding, driving while drunk, texting or not buckling up -- are fueling a highway death rate that increased more in 2015 than in half a century. After decades of decline, fatalities jumped by more than 7 percent that year, and early figures indicate that 2016 may be an even deadlier year. Nearly half of the 2015 fatalities involved an unbelted passenger or driver and about one-third were alcohol-related. Experts say stronger laws and beefed-up public awareness programs would help. And they say technological developments, including automatic braking and collision avoidance, also will save lives. Distracted driving raises new concerns: As more cars include hands-free capabilities for smartphones as standard equipment, safety experts warn that use of such devices is as dangerous as talking on hand-held versions. Self-driving cars are on the road in California, Pennsylvania and elsewhere, potentially adding another dimension to the possible safety solutions but raising new questions around the life-and-death choices the software programs in those vehicles must make.},

	abstract = {Objective: The objective of this research was to study the risk factors that significantly influence the severity of intersection crashes for vehicle occupants, as well as for pedestrians and other vulnerable road users. Methods: Logistic regression was applied as the method in this study to analyze a data set of intersection crashes involving casualties in Victoria, Australia, for the period January 2000 to December 2009. Results: Seven risk factors obtained were found to be significantly associated with the severity of intersection crashes, including driver age and gender, speed zone, traffic control type, time of day, crash type, and seat belt usage. Conclusions: This study found that male drivers as well as older drivers (age 65 and above) had higher odds of being involved in fatal intersection crashes. Intersection crashes occurring between midnight and early morning (12:00 a.m. to 5:59 a.m.), in 100 km/h speed zones, or with no traffic control had a higher odds of a fatal outcome than their counterpart categories. Furthermore, intersection crashes involving pedestrians or a non–seat belt–wearing driver were more likely to lead to a fatal outcome. In general, identification of risk factors and the discussion of the odds ratio between levels on the impact of the intersection crash severity would be beneficial for road safety stakeholders to develop initiatives to reduce the severity of intersection crashes.},

	shorttitle = {Distribution of road traffic deaths by road user group},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Road traffic deaths are a major global health and development problem. An understanding of the existing burden of road traffic deaths in the population is necessary for developing effective interventions. OBJECTIVE: To outline systematically the global distribution of road traffic deaths by road user groups (pedestrians, bicyclists, motorcyclists, motorised four-wheeler occupants). METHODS: Comprehensive searches of PubMed, Google, Google Scholar, TransportLink, grey literature and reference lists and communication with experts from international organisations and country-level institutions were conducted to identify eligible studies and data sources. All data sources that provided a breakdown of road traffic deaths by road user group at the national or sub-national level were eligible for inclusion. A breakdown of road traffic deaths by road user group was constructed for 14 epidemiologically defined World Health Organization (WHO) sub-regions in addition to World Bank income categories. In addition, the total number of road traffic fatalities by road user group in low-income, middle-income and high-income countries was estimated. RESULTS: The breakdown of road traffic deaths by road user group varies dramatically across epidemiological WHO sub-regions. The magnitude of pedestrian fatalities ranges from more than half in African sub-region AfrE (55\%) to 15\% or less in AmrA or EurA. The distribution also varies across low-income, middle-income and high-income countries. 45\% of road traffic fatalities in low-income countries are among pedestrians, whereas an estimated 29\% in middle-income and 18\% in high-income countries are among pedestrians. The burden of road traffic injuries on vulnerable road users differs substantially across income levels. An estimated total of 227 835 pedestrians die in low-income countries, as opposed to 161 501 in middle-income countries and 22 500 in high-income countries each year. CONCLUSIONS: Ameliorating road safety requires the implementation of context-specific solutions. This review of the road traffic injury literature provides strong evidence that the distribution of road traffic fatalities varies dramatically across different parts of the world. Therefore, context-appropriate and effective prevention strategies that protect the particular at-risk road user groups should be carefully investigated.},
