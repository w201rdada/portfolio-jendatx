### Abstract of my first cool idea {-}

"Pooook Prose Knuckles" are a pair of wearable devices - in the "brass knuckles" format - that support keyboard-free QWERTY or Dvorak typing no matter where the user happens to be. Consumers pair their Pooooks with any mobile device, and then sit at a keyboard for a few minutes to parrot a few phrases that train the included machine learning software to recognize their own personalized typing habits. Wearing Pooooks out and about, neither the scientist in the field nor the cop on the street must wait until they're back at a desk to perform a real-time precision search or record a critical observation - all without making a sound.

### Abstract of my second cool idea {-}

The "See Around Corners" project uses IoT sensors and edge computing to smarten-up dangerous intersections. Known-problematic intersections will be fitted out with arrays of inexpensive vibration sensors, and a team of Data Scientists will train each intersection node to classify and predict trajectories for all roadway user types - be they pedestrians, cyclists, vehicles, etc. No personally-identifiable information need be stored or transmitted over the internet. Working with the Vision Zero Network, the team will help auto-braking and self-driving car manufacturers make use of the smart intersection data, as well as develop a mobile app for use by municipalities and individuals.
