#### Keywords {wearables, touch typing, keyboarding, knuckles}

 With the miniature accelerometers now available, anyone who can touch-type on a keyboard should be able to ditch that bulky ⌨️ gear and instead compose their prose from any surface at hand, perhaps:

  * a lunch counter,
  * an arm chair, or
  * even one's own legs.

  The Pooook Prose Knuckles concept is to embed the necessary sensor circuits into a pair of wearable input devices having the form factor of brass knuckles, but bendy like those Livestrong bracelets. Just pair them with your smartphone and parrot a few sample prompts to train your personalized keyboard-free Pooooks.

## The Keyboard Crutch

It never fails: you finally step out for lunch and then your 📱 blows up with texts, slack messages, and emails. You spend your mid-day "break" face-down in your phone, or else half-conversing with your preferred colleagues (while mentally composing responses you'll send to non-preferred colleagues - once back at your desk).

It's not just desk workers who could benefit from board-cutting in addition to cord-cutting. Consider:

* the farmer 👨‍🌾 inspecting a field,
* the scientist 👨🏾‍🔬 elbows-deep in an experiment,
* the investigative journalist 🕵️‍♀️ chasing a quickly-developing 📰 story
* the surgeon 👩‍⚕️ already prepped for surgery,
* the activist blogger 🧕🏽 attending a protest
* the cop 👮🏽 out walking the beat, etc.

In all of the above cases, silently capturing observations (or executing just-in-time precision searches) could be invaluable. (Yes, the surgeon should wear her Pooook devices *under* her medical gloves.)

It's time we kicked our species' reliance on the ⌨️  to the curb. Someday soon, they're going to look about as antiquated as the punch card.

## Kicking the Keyboard Habit

Building on the [Ring GINA wearable computer interaction devices](/http://www-bsac.eecs.berkeley.edu/publications/search/send_publication_pdf2client.php?pubID=1381271517) developed by Joseph Greenspun and Kristofer S. J. Pister of UC Berkeley's Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, the Pooook flexible knuckle-sets would first be designed and 3D printed with the end goal being to insert the necessary accelerometers, Bluetooth connectors, and ⌚-style "self-winding" batteries.

Prototype users with measurably-strong [QWERTY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY) and/or [Dvorak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard) touch-typing skills would be needed to assist with the machine learning portion of the project. Beginning on the keyboards themselves, Pooook wearers would parrot prompted alphanumeric characters, and the software would learn how to classify accelerated movement in x-y-z space patterns (inclusive of primary-motion digit AND adjacent digits) into various tiers of increasingly-complex inputs, for example:

 * Tier 1 letters: "a" vs "q" and "z", "f" vs "r" and "v", etc.
 * Tier 2 punctuation: <spacebar>, <return>, "'", ",", ".", ";"
 * Tier 3 capital letters requiring shifting
 * Tier 4 punctuation requiring shifting (e.g. "?", quotes, etc.)
 * Tier 5 numbers
 * Tier 6 special characters

 "Ground truth" for machine learning would always begin with keyboards present PLUS characters, words, and then strings prompted onscreen for user reference. Later tests would move on to user-improvised content, with feedback on accuracy supplied by typist participants. Once accuracy of the software is solid on the keyboards, the team will move on to keyboard-less input (first prompted, then improvised) on flat, hard horizontal surfaces. Over time, slanted/vertical solid surfaces and then ultimately pliant and/or curved surfaces (like the users' own legs) would be trained. Both group patterns and personalization of the software will be of interest, as we'll seek to make the product's base "common-denominator" algorithm better and better over time...so later generations of Pooook customers will experience snappy training times (and less frustration) for their own personal Pooook devices.   

## The Post-Keyboard Era

Once we're free of keyboards, we can get out into the world more and record better the truth of what we find there - as well as what we think about it. Who hasn't taken a hike 🏞️, freeing the mind to bring forth the answer to a pressing problem? Capturing spontaneous thoughts for later usage frees the mind to move onto *more* creative thoughts - without having to concentrate on storage of thoughts 1 through 37...

Yes, there's the danger that humans will use Pooook on a steering wheel while 🚗 - but at least we can keep our eyes on the road (unlike with those tiny 📱  keyboards that have no tactile feedback whatsoever). Combining voice and Pooook input could make traffic jams much more productive.

In addition, there are millions of people for whom the 📱 is their only means of connection to the information age. Without full-size keyboard hardware to make composition easy and efficient, some may feel relegated to the role of information accessors, not as much information contributors. It's time everyone benefited from the contributions 📈 of all of us.

Also just because Pooook would be first developed for the English QWERTY and Dvorak keyboards, that *certainly* doesn't mean Pooook software models would stop there. In fact, the Pooook team aims to design an API-first platform, so that anyone can extend their Pooook devices to provide precise input where needed, like:

 * international ⌨️ s
 * accessibility tools, and more
