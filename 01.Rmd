#### Keywords {wearables, touch typing, keyboarding, knuckles}

 With the miniature accelerometers now available, anyone who can touch-type on a keyboard should be able to ditch that bulky ⌨️ gear and instead compose their prose from any surface at hand, perhaps:

  * a lunch counter,
  * an arm chair, or
  * even one's own legs.

  The Pooook Prose Knuckles concept is to embed the necessary sensor circuits into a pair of wearable input devices having the form factor of brass knuckles, but bendy like those Livestrong bracelets. Just pair them with your smartphone and parrot a few sample prompts to train your personalized keyboard-free Pooooks.

## The Keyboard Crutch

It never fails: you finally step out for lunch and then your 📱 blows up with texts, slack messages, and emails. You spend your mid-day "break" face-down in your phone, or else half-conversing with your preferred colleagues (while mentally composing responses you'll send to non-preferred colleagues - once back at your desk).

It's not just desk workers who could benefit from board-cutting in addition to cord-cutting. Consider:

* the farmer 👨‍🌾 inspecting a field,
* the scientist 👨🏾‍🔬 elbows-deep in an experiment,
* the investigative journalist 🕵️‍♀️ chasing a quickly-developing 📰 story
* the surgeon 👩‍⚕️ already prepped for surgery,
* the activist blogger 🧕🏽 attending a protest
* the cop 👮🏽 out walking the beat, etc.

In all of the above cases, silently capturing observations (or executing just-in-time precision searches) could be invaluable. (Yes, the surgeon should wear her Pooook devices *under* her medical gloves.)

It's time we kicked our species' reliance on the ⌨️  to the curb. Someday soon, they're going to look about as antiquated as the punch card.

## How Data Science can Help Kick the Keyboard Habit

Building on the [Ring GINA wearable computer interaction devices](http://www-bsac.eecs.berkeley.edu/publications/search/zoom.php?urltimestamp=1381271517) developed by Joseph Greenspun and Kristofer S. J. Pister of UC Berkeley's Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, the Pooook flexible knuckle-sets would first be designed and 3D printed with the end goal being to insert the necessary accelerometers, Bluetooth connectors, and ⌚-style "self-winding" batteries.

Prototype users with measurably-strong [QWERTY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY) and/or [Dvorak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard) touch-typing skills would be needed to assist with the machine learning portion of the project. Beginning on the keyboards themselves, Pooook wearers would parrot prompted alphanumeric characters, and the software would learn how to classify accelerated movement in x-y-z space patterns (inclusive of primary-motion digit AND adjacent digits) into various tiers of increasingly-complex inputs, for example:

 * Tier 1 letters: "a" vs "q" and "z", "f" vs "r" and "v", etc.
 * Tier 2 essential punctuation: spacebar, return, apostrophe, comma, period, semi-colon
 * Tier 3 punctuation requiring shifting (e.g. "?", quotes, colon etc.)
 * Tier 4 capital letters (again requiring shifting)
 * Tier 5 numbers (based on user feedback, version 1 may approach via number-keypad)
 * Tier 6 special characters (@, $, %, +, -, \*, /, etc.)

For each tier, the "ground truth" for machine learning must always begin with keyboards under the hands of Pooook-wearing typists, who input screen-prompted characters, words, and phrases. Once successful, keyboard hardware will be removed and replaced with solid flat surfaces, then angled, curved, soft, etc.

This keyboard-first approach will be prescribed to end-user customers as well (whether at home or stores/libraries), so that the software can be personalized to the way each individual typist engages. To achieve snappy time-to-value with the product, it is  essential to the team that Pooook customers have no need to change their behavior. Customers will train the Pooook and not the other way around. 

## The Post-Keyboard Era

Once freed from bulky keyboards, humans can more easily get out into the world - reporting better the truth of what we find there, and what we think about these findings. We should benefit form additional voices, too. For perhaps a billion of us, the 📱 is the only means of connection to the information age. Without full-size keyboard hardware to make composition easy and efficient, some may feel relegated to the role of information accessors, not as much information contributors. It's time the global community benefited from the contributions of all of us 📈.

While Pooook would be first developed for the English QWERTY and Dvorak keyboards, that *certainly* doesn't mean Pooook software models would stop there. In fact, the Pooook team aims to design an API-first platform, so that anyone can extend their Pooook devices to provide precise input as needed, like:

 * international ⌨️ s
 * accessibility tools, and more
