["brass-knuckles-for-the-information-age.html", "1 Pooook Prose Knuckles 1.1 Still Chained to our Keyboards? 1.2 Data Science to Kick the Keyboard Habit 1.3 The Post-Keyboard Era", " 1 Pooook Prose Knuckles Figure 1.1: Prototype Design 1.0.0.1 Keywords {wearables, touch type, keyboarding, knuckles} 1.1 Still Chained to our Keyboards? Picture a desk worker, stepping out for lunch - only to have his or her phone blow up with texts, messages, and emails 🔥📱🔥. Should this mid-day “break” be spent mentally composing - and hoping to later recall - intended replies until back at a keyboard? Or face-down, inefficiently stabbing at a tiny alphabet on a tiny screen? These choices are especially painful for those of us who can touch-type with speed and accuracy. We’re the ones who type only a little slower than we think. We’re the ones who find voice recognition software especially galling: all that imprecision with key people/place/product names, punctuation and formatting requires time-consuming rework. Not to mention that dictating sensitive content requires constant access to a quiet, private place - lest we be overheard. What we want is a way to untether our typing skills…without having to ditch years of muscle memory. There is a “coming soon” product called Tap that purports to offer keyboard-free gesture recognition for “typing, gaming, music and more,” but this device requires users spend hours getting trained with uncomfortable new fingerings (“d” is typed by pressing down with the middle and pinky fingers, while lifting the ring finger, for instance). If we wanted to learn guitar- or piano-like chord fingerings, we’d pick up a musical instrument! Instead, it’s time we design a wearable solution that leverages our time-tested typing skills - already standardized via QWERTY and Dvorak keyboards. With the miniature accelerometers that can translate motion into device input now at hobbyist pricepoints, we can loose the chains tying good typists to our keyboards. There’s really no good reason why we can’t compose our prose on any surface - literally - at hand. And it’s not just desk workers who could benefit from board-cutting in addition to cord-cutting. Picture: the farmer 👩🏼 🌾 inspecting a field, the scientist 👨🏾 🔬 elbows-deep in an experiment, the investigative journalist 🕵🏼 chasing a quickly-developing 📰 story the surgeon 👩 ⚕️ already prepped for surgery, the activist blogger 🧕🏽 attending a protest the cop 👮🏽 out walking the beat, etc. In all of the above cases, silently capturing observations (or executing just-in-time precision searches) could be invaluable. There’s really no need for our species’ continued reliance on the keyboard. Someday soon, keyboards are going to look about as antiquated as the punch card. 1.2 Data Science to Kick the Keyboard Habit The Pooook Prose Knuckles product concept is to embed the necessary sensor circuits into a pair of wearable input devices having the form factor of brass knuckles, but bendy like those Livestrong bracelets. The consumer owning a pair of Pooooks would pair them with a phone or tablet, and then simply parrot a few on-screen prompts to train their personalized wearables to interpret their individual typing style. The design would build on the Ring GINA wearable computer interaction devices (Greenspun and Pister 2014) developed in UC Berkeley’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Our data science team would design Pooook flexible knuckle-sets to be 3D printed with the end goal being to insert the necessary accelerometers, Bluetooth connectors, and wristwatch-style “self-winding” batteries. Once we assemble the prototype devices, the data science team would recruit touch-typing testers with measurably fast and accurate keyboarding skills for the machine learning portion of the project. For each tier in the increasingly-complex standard keyboard inputs listed below, the data science team would design software to classify Pooook-sensed accelerated finger movements in x-y-z space, outputting granular values corresponding to typed input: Tier 1 letters: “a” vs “q” and “z”, “f” vs “r” and “v”, etc. Tier 2 essential punctuation: spacebar, return, delete, apostrophe, comma, period… Tier 3 punctuation requiring shifting (e.g. “?”, quotes, colon etc.) Tier 4 capital letters (again requiring shifting) Tier 5 numbers (both inline and via number-keypads like those used by cashiers) Tier 6 special characters (@, $, %, +, -, *, /, etc.) The “ground truth” for machine learning in each tier would always begin with keyboards under the hands of the Pooook-wearing typists, who would input expected (screen-prompted, then later improvised) characters, words, and phrases. Once accuracy is proven with keyboards in place, the keyboard hardware would be removed and replaced with solid flat surfaces (like a desk), angled flats (like an airplane’s fold-down tray), and ultimately curved &amp; softer spots like chair arms and the typists’ laps. This keyboard-first approach would be recommended to the ultimate consumers as well (whether at home or in stores/schools/libraries), so that the software can be personalized to the way each individual typist engages. To achieve snappy time-to-value for new owners of the product, the data science goal should be that Pooook customers have no need to change their typing behavior. Customers should train the Pooooks, and not the other way around. 1.3 The Post-Keyboard Era Once freed from bulky keyboards, humans can more easily get out into the world - reporting better the truth of what we find there, and what we think about these findings. We’ll procrastinate and forget less, as we won’t have to put off until later that which we can do RIGHT. NOW. All of us could benefit, too, from additional contributors. Perhaps a billion of our fellow travelers on this planet use their 📱 as their only means of connection to the information age. Without full-size keyboards to make prose composition easy and efficient, some may feel relegated to the role of information accessors, not as much information creators. It’s time the internet era benefited from the voices and ideas of all of us 📈. While Pooook would first be developed for the English QWERTY and Dvorak keyboards, that certainly doesn’t mean Pooook software models would stop there. In fact, the Pooook data science team should aim to design an API-first platform, so that developers everywhere could extend their Pooook software to provide precise input as needed in more circumstances: international languages, math, science, and industry-specifics, accessibility tools, and more. Isn’t it time for wearable precision input devices? Join the Pooook team today! Bibliography "],

Perhaps 50 Million people are injured in this way each year, causing untold pain and productivity loss. Many are counting on the advent of self-driving cars to cure the problem, yet it could very well be decades before any given country’s fleet is fully automated. Let’s not wait on that solution. About 40% of crashes take place at intersections [National Highway Traffic Safety Administration], and it has been determined that over 50% of those intersection crashes are due to “inadequate intersection surveillance” and “turning into an intersection with an obstructed view”. These causes point directly to a lack of information on-hand in the moment the information is needed - something that we in the so-called information age should be able to address. Planners have long studied dangerous intersections where - time and time again - people and property get damaged, reports get written, debris is cleared away, and then traffic flow continues…until the next crash. What if, instead of waiting for a slowly-increasing number of smart cars to learn to handle every possible roadway condition plus every style of intersection, we instead invested in instrumenting known-bad intersections, turning them into connected objects. They could become self-sensing &amp; informed, knowing their own historical pitfalls. And then they could become proactive, monitoring themselves and their users, preventing accidents, and even notifying emergency responders if needed. Figure 2.1: Curve + slope = dangerous intersection There are some investing in this way, wiring up cameras at intersections in order to use computer vision to detect, classify and warn of potential conflicts. This work with video is challenging, however, “due to the constant change of orientation and appearance of pedestrians and cyclists”[Transportation Research]. The following proposal recommends another path, relying on less variable characteristics. The objective is to find a solution that is inexpensive and effective at preventing collisions and the suffering they cause. 2.2 The Data Science of Smart Intersections The key to this project’s approach lies in the classification and characterization of roadway users according to mass (which, unlike orientation, should not change during a given roadway traversal) and velocity (which changes within predictable user-category bounds). The combination of the two is momentum - literally defined as mass in motion. Momentum is an especially appropriate factor for classification and prediction in a traffic risk-avoidance scenario because momentum is conserved in a collision: the wider the gap between two objects’ momentums, the more potential harm to the lower-momentum party. For this pilot project, momentum would be determined for each roadway user approaching an intersection via semi-permanent installation of a series of inexpensive, weather-proof vibration-sensor packs. Each individual sensor-pack would be a combination of piezoelectric elements - converting various levels of vibration into various levels of voltage - and an array of vibration sensor switches - which either do or do not close a circuit, depending on the level of vibration impinging upon them. Initial placement is envisioned along the vertical walls of the existing curbing on all intersection approach paths. (After the pilot project demonstrates promise in accident avoidance with this method, further miniaturization and component hardening may allow the necessary components to be installed into standard roadway reflectors - bridging coverage to intersections without curbing.) An intersection’s set of sensor-packs should be connected wirelessly to communicate their identities, placements, and vibration readings in real-time to the smart intersection’s own network hub, which itself would be connected to the internet for monitoring, maintenance, and in case of emergency reporting. Note that no personally-identifiable information would be transmitted (unlike with cameras); this fact alone should make public acceptance easier. Once a pilot intersection is set up for detection and signal reception/connection, the Data Science team would supervise training of the smart intersection software so that the intersection can behave as a true node in the transit grid. The software would need to be able to translate detected momentum patterns into risk categories, identifying, for instance: a cat 🐈 vs. a scooter commuter 🛴 vs. a wheelchair user ♿ vs. a cyclist 🚴♀️ vs. a giant delivery truck 🚚, etc. Ground truth for any given intersection could be input for training by means of temporary detours while testers traverse the intersection via common routes and methods, including any known-hard-to-detect edge-cases, especially for vulnerable populations. Prior to “going live”, transportation safety staff could easily conduct a gauge repeatability and reproducibility study, logging the smart intersection’s new instrumented capabilities and/or blindspots. Once live, the intersection’s status (for instance, 2 cyclists approaching uphill, a delivery van barreling downhill, and a wheelchair entering a crosswalk with an obstructed view) could be broadcast locally to a “See Around Corners” mobile app specifically designed to navigate intersections with historical issues. Commuters who frequent said intersections could download and activate the app to receive voice warnings, such as “Incoming downhill!” Notice especially that these commuters could be drivers, pedestrians, cyclists, or other. The fundamental research question then becomes: can machine learning be used to train a smart intersection node to detect and classify roadway users, predicting their potential paths with enough precision to warn users before a collision? If it can, what level of false positives and false negatives should be expected and accepted? And then what are the incentives that stakeholders - like local governments, parents, and insurers - can offer in order to encourage informed app usage by the populace? 2.3 Self-Driving Cars Should Co-Exist with Smart Intersections Self-driving cars are on the way, and that’s great. When cars can keep each other informed about which resources are needed by whom and when, accident rates, suffering, and costs should decrease. But mixed-mode transit is here to stay, and therefore we can’t expect vehicles alone to carry all the burden of preventing roadway injury and death. There are too many other actors in this play. For instance, while &gt; 90% of all road fatalities occur in low and middle-income countries, these countries possess less than half of the world’s vehicles [ASIRT]. How can this be? The essential insight is that nearly half of all deaths on the world’s roads impact those without cars: these are victims who walk or ride alongside cars (referred to as “vulnerable roadway users”). The truism that a society should be judged on how it cares for its most vulnerable certainly applies to intersection safety. Morally, then, we should be designing traffic safety solutions designed to fold in (but not rely on) autonomous vehicles. Every node - including smart, self-sensing intersections - in our transit grid can contribute. It’s time we smarten up our intersections so they can serve and protect us all. 🚌 - ♿ - 🏍️ - 🛹 - 🚒 - 🚶🏿 - 🛵 - 🛹 - 🏎️ - ⛹️♀️ - 🛴 - 🏃🏼 - 🧳 - 🚙 - 🚴🏽♀️ - 🚓 - 🚇 "],
