["brass-knuckles-for-the-information-age.html", "1 Pooook Prose Knuckles 1.1 Still Chained to our Keyboards? 1.2 Data Science to Kick the Keyboard Habit 1.3 The Post-Keyboard Era", " 1 Pooook Prose Knuckles Figure 1.1: Prototype Design 1.0.0.1 Keywords {wearables, touch type, keyboarding, knuckles} 1.1 Still Chained to our Keyboards? Picture a desk worker, stepping out for lunch - only to have his or her phone blow up with texts, messages, and emails 🔥📱🔥. Should this mid-day “break” be spent mentally composing - and hoping to later recall - intended replies until back at a keyboard? Or face-down, inefficiently stabbing at a tiny alphabet on a tiny screen? These choices are especially painful for those of us who can touch-type with speed and accuracy. We’re the ones who type only a little slower than we think. We’re the ones who find voice recognition software especially galling: all that imprecision with key people/place/product names, punctuation and formatting requires time-consuming rework. Not to mention that dictating sensitive content requires constant access to a quiet, private place - lest we be overheard. What we want is a way to untether our typing skills…without having to ditch years of muscle memory. There is a “coming soon” product called Tap that purports to offer keyboard-free gesture recognition for “typing, gaming, music and more,” but this device requires users spend hours getting trained with uncomfortable new fingerings (“d” is typed by pressing down with the middle and pinky fingers, while lifting the ring finger, for instance). If we wanted to learn guitar- or piano-like chord fingerings, we’d pick up a musical instrument! Instead, it’s time we design a wearable solution that leverages our time-tested typing skills - already standardized via QWERTY and Dvorak keyboards. With the miniature accelerometers that can translate motion into device input now at hobbyist pricepoints, we can loose the chains tying good typists to our keyboards. There’s really no good reason why we can’t compose our prose on any surface - literally - at hand. And it’s not just desk workers who could benefit from board-cutting in addition to cord-cutting. Picture: the farmer 👩🏼 🌾 inspecting a field, the scientist 👨🏾 🔬 elbows-deep in an experiment, the investigative journalist 🕵🏼 chasing a quickly-developing 📰 story the surgeon 👩 ⚕️ already prepped for surgery, the activist blogger 🧕🏽 attending a protest the cop 👮🏽 out walking the beat, etc. In all of the above cases, silently capturing observations (or executing just-in-time precision searches) could be invaluable. There’s really no need for our species’ continued reliance on the keyboard. Someday soon, keyboards are going to look about as antiquated as the punch card. 1.2 Data Science to Kick the Keyboard Habit The Pooook Prose Knuckles product concept is to embed the necessary sensor circuits into a pair of wearable input devices having the form factor of brass knuckles, but bendy like those Livestrong bracelets. The consumer owning a pair of Pooooks would pair them with a phone or tablet, and then simply parrot a few on-screen prompts to train their personalized wearables to interpret their individual typing style. The design would build on the Ring GINA wearable computer interaction devices (Greenspun and Pister 2014) developed in UC Berkeley’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Our data science team would design Pooook flexible knuckle-sets to be 3D printed with the end goal being to insert the necessary accelerometers, Bluetooth connectors, and wristwatch-style “self-winding” batteries. Once we assemble the prototype devices, the data science team would recruit touch-typing testers with measurably fast and accurate keyboarding skills for the machine learning portion of the project. For each tier in the increasingly-complex standard keyboard inputs listed below, the data science team would design software to classify Pooook-sensed accelerated finger movements in x-y-z space, outputting granular values corresponding to typed input: Tier 1 letters: “a” vs “q” and “z”, “f” vs “r” and “v”, etc. Tier 2 essential punctuation: spacebar, return, delete, apostrophe, comma, period… Tier 3 punctuation requiring shifting (e.g. “?”, quotes, colon etc.) Tier 4 capital letters (again requiring shifting) Tier 5 numbers (both inline and via number-keypads like those used by cashiers) Tier 6 special characters (@, $, %, +, -, *, /, etc.) The “ground truth” for machine learning in each tier would always begin with keyboards under the hands of the Pooook-wearing typists, who would input expected (screen-prompted, then later improvised) characters, words, and phrases. Once accuracy is proven with keyboards in place, the keyboard hardware would be removed and replaced with solid flat surfaces (like a desk), angled flats (like an airplane’s fold-down tray), and ultimately curved &amp; softer spots like chair arms and the typists’ laps. This keyboard-first approach would be recommended to the ultimate consumers as well (whether at home or in stores/schools/libraries), so that the software can be personalized to the way each individual typist engages. To achieve snappy time-to-value for new owners of the product, the data science goal should be that Pooook customers have no need to change their typing behavior. Customers should train the Pooooks, and not the other way around. 1.3 The Post-Keyboard Era Once freed from bulky keyboards, humans can more easily get out into the world - reporting better the truth of what we find there, and what we think about these findings. We’ll procrastinate and forget less, as we won’t have to put off until later that which we can do RIGHT. NOW. All of us could benefit, too, from additional contributors. Perhaps a billion of our fellow travelers on this planet use their 📱 as their only means of connection to the information age. Without full-size keyboards to make prose composition easy and efficient, some may feel relegated to the role of information accessors, not as much information creators. It’s time the internet era benefited from the voices and ideas of all of us 📈. While Pooook would first be developed for the English QWERTY and Dvorak keyboards, that certainly doesn’t mean Pooook software models would stop there. In fact, the Pooook data science team should aim to design an API-first platform, so that developers everywhere could extend their Pooook software to provide precise input as needed in more circumstances: international languages, math, science, and industry-specifics, accessibility tools, and more. Isn’t it time for wearable precision input devices? Join the Pooook team today! Bibliography "],

Perhaps 50 Million people are injured in this way each year, causing untold pain and productivity loss. Many are counting on the advent of self-driving cars to cure the problem, yet it could very well be decades before any given country’s fleet is fully automated. Let’s not wait on that solution. About 40% of crashes take place at intersections [National Highway Traffic Safety Administration], and it has been determined that over 50% of those crashes are due to “inadequate surveillance” and “turning with an obstructed view”. These causes point directly to a lack of information on-hand, something that we in the so-called information age should be able to address. Planners have long studied dangerous intersections where - time and time again - people and property get damaged, reports get written, debris is cleared away, and then traffic flow continues…until the next crash. What if, instead of waiting for a slowly-increasing number of smart cars to learn to navigate every possible condition, we invested in known-bad intersections, turning them into connected objects - that know their own historical pitfalls and are given the functionality to monitor and alert users to potential dangers? Figure 2.1: Proceed with care Some are investigating this approach, placing cameras at intersections in order to use computer vision to detect, classify and warn of potential conflicts. This work with video is challenging, however, “due to the constant change of orientation and appearance of pedestrians and cyclists”[Transportation Research]. The following proposal recommends another path, relying on less variable characteristics in order to deliver more predictable data … perhaps at costs that could get us more coverage, much sooner. 2.2 Data Science for Smart Intersections The key to this new approach lies in the classification of momentum as detected by sequences of small, inexpensive vibration sensors. As momentum is literally a measure of mass in motion, this approach marries the predictability of a factor that won’t change (mass) with a factor that certainly can (velocity = speed + direction). The fundamental question is: can software both detect the presence of intersection users AND inform other users, all quickly enough (and with enough accuracy) to prevent resource contention in the form of a collision? This proposal would aim to make use of low-profile vibration sensors, mounted along curb sides/road shoulders on the approach to problematic intersection. These sensors would need to be slim, weather-proof, and well-adhered. They should be connected so as to communicate their identity, location, and vibration readings wirelessly to the intersection’s own sensor network hub, which should also be connected to the internet. Note that no personally-identifiable information would be transmitted (unlike with cameras); this should make public acceptance easier. Once a pilot intersection is set up for detection and signal reception/connection, the Data Science team would supervise training of the smart intersection software so that the intersection can behave as a true node in the transit grid. The software would need to be able to translate detected momentum patterns into risk categories (identifying, for instance, everything from a 🐈 or 🛴 or 🚴 ♀️ or 🚚, etc.). Ground truth could be provided for training by implementing temporary detours while testers use the intersection via all common routes and methods. The intersection’s status (for instance, 2 pedestrians approaching uphill, plus a delivery van barreling downhill) could be broadcast locally in real-time to a “See Around Corners” smart intersection mobile app. Commuters who frequent dangerous intersections could download and activate the app to receive voice warnings, such as “Incoming downhill!” or “On your left!” Notice that these commuters could be drivers, pedestrians, cyclists, etc. #NoAutoRequired 2.3 Self-Driving Cars Must Co-Exist with Smart Intersections Self-driving cars are here, and more are on the way, and that’s great. When cars can keep each other informed about which resources are needed by whom and when, accident rates, suffering, and costs should decrease. But mixed-mode transit is here to stay, and therefore we can’t expect vehicles alone to carry all the burden of preventing roadway injury and death. There are too many other actors in this play. For instance, while &gt; 90% of all road fatalities occur in low and middle-income countries, these countries possess less than half of the world’s vehicles [ASIRT]. How can this be? The essential insight is that nearly half of all deaths on the world’s roads impact those without cars: these are victims who walk or ride alongside cars (referred to as “vulnerable roadway users”). The truism that a society should be judged on how it cares for its most vulnerable certainly applies to intersection safety. Morally, then, we should be designing traffic safety solutions designed to fold in (but not rely on) autonomous vehicles. Every node - including self-sensing intersections - in our transit grid can help. It’s time we smarten up our intersections so they can serve and protect us all. 🚌 - ♿ - 🏍️ - 🚒 - 🚶🏿 - 🛵 - 🛹 - 🏎️ - ⛹️ ♀️ - 🛴 - 🏃🏼 - 🚙 - 🚴🏽 ♀️ - 🚓 "],
