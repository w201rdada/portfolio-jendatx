<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Smart, Self-Sensing Intersections Could Save Lives</h2>
<p>Every day, thousands of lives are lost worldwide when cars collide with each other and with other roadway users (pedestrians, cyclists, etc.)[Association for Safe International Road Travel]. Perhaps 50 Million people are injured in this way each year, causing untold pain and productivity loss. Many are counting on the advent of self-driving cars to cure the problem, yet it could very well be decades before any given country’s fleet is fully automated. Let’s not wait on that solution.</p>
<p>About 40% of crashes take place at intersections [National Highway Traffic Safety Administration], and it has been determined that over 50% of those intersection crashes are due to “inadequate intersection surveillance” and “turning into an intersection with an obstructed view”. These causes point directly to a lack of information on-hand in the moment the information is needed - something that we in the so-called <em>information age</em> should be able to address.</p>
<p>Planners have long studied dangerous intersections where - time and time again - people and property get damaged, reports get written, debris is cleared away, and then traffic flow continues…until the next crash. What if, instead of waiting for a slowly-increasing number of smart cars to learn to handle every possible roadway condition plus every style of intersection, we instead invested in instrumenting known-bad intersections, turning them into connected objects. They could become self-sensing &amp; informed, knowing their own historical pitfalls. And then they could become proactive, monitoring themselves and their users, preventing accidents, and even notifying emergency responders if needed.</p>

<p>There are some investing in this way, wiring up cameras at intersections in order to use computer vision to detect, classify and warn of potential conflicts. This work with video is challenging, however, “due to the constant change of orientation and appearance of pedestrians and cyclists”[Transportation Research]. The following proposal recommends another path, relying on less variable characteristics. The objective is to find a solution that is inexpensive and effective at preventing collisions and the suffering they cause.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-data-science-of-smart-intersections" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> The Data Science of Smart Intersections</h2>
<p>The key to this project’s approach lies in the classification and characterization of roadway users according to mass (which, unlike orientation, should <em>not</em> change during a given roadway traversal) and velocity (which changes within predictable user-category bounds). The combination of the two is momentum - literally defined as mass in motion. Momentum is an especially appropriate factor for classification and prediction in a traffic risk-avoidance scenario because momentum is conserved in a collision: the wider the gap between two objects’ momentums, the more potential harm to the lower-momentum party.</p>
<p>For this pilot project, momentum would be determined for each roadway user approaching an intersection via semi-permanent installation of a series of inexpensive, weather-proof vibration-sensor packs. Each individual sensor-pack would be a combination of <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/1739">piezoelectric elements</a> - converting various levels of vibration into various levels of voltage - and an array of <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/?q=vibration%20sensor%20switch">vibration sensor switches</a> - which either do or do not close a circuit, depending on the level of vibration impinging upon them. Initial placement is envisioned along the vertical walls of the existing curbing on all intersection approach paths. (After the pilot project demonstrates promise in accident avoidance with this method, further miniaturization and component hardening may allow the necessary components to be installed into standard roadway reflectors - bridging coverage to intersections without curbing.)</p>
<p>An intersection’s set of sensor-packs should be connected wirelessly to communicate their identities, placements, and vibration readings in real-time to the smart intersection’s own network hub, which itself would be connected to the internet for monitoring, maintenance, and in case of emergency reporting. Note that no personally-identifiable information would be transmitted (unlike with cameras); this fact alone should make public acceptance easier.</p>
<p>Once a pilot intersection is set up for detection and signal reception/connection, the Data Science team would supervise training of the smart intersection software so that the intersection can behave as a true node in the transit grid. The software would need to be able to translate detected momentum patterns into risk categories, identifying, for instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>a cat 🐈 vs.</li>
<li>a scooter commuter 🛴 vs.</li>
<li>a wheelchair user ♿ vs.</li>
<li>a cyclist 🚴♀️ vs.</li>
<li>a giant delivery truck 🚚, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ground truth for any given intersection could be input for training by means of temporary detours while testers traverse the intersection via common routes and methods, including any known-hard-to-detect edge-cases, especially for vulnerable populations. Prior to “going live”, transportation safety staff could easily conduct a gauge repeatability and reproducibility study, logging the smart intersection’s new instrumented capabilities and/or blindspots.</p>
<p>Once live, the intersection’s status (for instance, 2 cyclists approaching uphill, a delivery van barreling downhill, and a wheelchair entering a crosswalk with an obstructed view) could be broadcast locally to a “See Around Corners” mobile app specifically designed to navigate intersections with historical issues. Commuters who frequent said intersections could download and activate the app to receive voice warnings, such as “Incoming downhill!” Notice especially that these commuters could be drivers, pedestrians, cyclists, or other.</p>
<p>The fundamental research question then becomes: can machine learning be used to train a smart intersection node to detect and classify roadway users, predicting their potential paths with enough precision to warn users <em>before</em> a collision? If it can, what level of false positives and false negatives should be expected and accepted? And then what are the incentives that stakeholders - like local governments, parents, and insurers - can offer in order to encourage informed app usage by the populace?</p>

<div id="self-driving-cars-should-co-exist-with-smart-intersections" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Self-Driving Cars Should Co-Exist with Smart Intersections</h2>
<p>Self-driving cars are on the way, and that’s great. When cars can keep each other informed about which resources are needed by whom and when, accident rates, suffering, and costs should decrease.</p>
<p>But mixed-mode transit is here to stay, and therefore we can’t expect vehicles alone to carry all the burden of preventing roadway injury and death. There are too many other actors in this play. For instance, while &gt; 90% of all road fatalities occur in low and middle-income countries, these countries possess less than half of the world’s vehicles [ASIRT]. How can this be? The essential insight is that nearly half of all deaths on the world’s roads impact those <em>without</em> cars: these are victims who walk or ride alongside cars (referred to as “vulnerable roadway users”). The truism that a society should be judged on how it cares for its most vulnerable certainly applies to intersection safety.</p>
<p>Morally, then, we should be designing traffic safety solutions designed to fold in (but not rely on) autonomous vehicles. Every node - including smart, self-sensing intersections - in our transit grid can contribute. It’s time we smarten up our intersections so they can serve and protect us all.</p>
