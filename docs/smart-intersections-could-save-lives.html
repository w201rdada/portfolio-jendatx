<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Smart, Self-Sensing Intersections Could Save Lives</h2>
<p>According to the <a href="http://asirt.org/initiatives/informing-road-users/road-safety-facts/road-crash-statistics">Association for Safe International Road Travel</a>, thousands of lives are lost worldwide each day when cars collide with each other and with other roadway users, such as motorcyclists, pedestrians, cyclists, etc. Such collisions also lead to tens of millions of injuries each year, causing untold pain and productivity loss. Many count on the advent of self-driving cars to fix the problem for good, yet it could very well be decades before even a single country’s fleet is fully automated. Let’s not wait on that solution.</p>
<p>About 40% of crashes take place at intersections <span class="citation">(Choi <a href="#ref-choi_crash_2010">2010</a>)</span>, and it has been determined that over 50% of those intersection crashes are due to either “inadequate intersection surveillance” or “turning into an intersection with an obstructed view”. These causes point directly to a lack of information on-hand in the moment a critical decision is being made - something that we in the so-called <em>information age</em> should be able to address.</p>
<p>Researchers have analyzed years of data regarding dangerous intersections where - time and time again - people and property are harmed, reports are written, debris is cleared away, and then traffic flow continues…until the next crash <span class="citation">(Chen, Cao, and Logan <a href="#ref-chen_analysis_2012">2012</a>)</span>. Everything gets scrutinized, down to crosswalk wait times and headphone use <span class="citation">(Brosseau et al. <a href="#ref-brosseau_impact_2013">2013</a>)</span> and even gender differences in car-bicycle crashes at urban intersections <span class="citation">(Stipancic et al. <a href="#ref-stipancic_investigating_2016">2016</a>)</span>. But few are making plans to bridge the main information gap directly: what resource contention might be predicted for the same strip of asphalt, concrete, gravel, or dirt.</p>
<p>What if, instead of waiting for a slowly-growing number of smart cars to learn to handle every possible roadway condition plus every possible style of intersection, we instead invested in instrumenting known-bad intersections, turning them into informed, connected objects, with knowledge of their own historical pitfalls? What if they could become proactive, monitoring themselves and their users, preventing accidents, and even notifying emergency responders if needed.</p>

<p>There are a few investigating this approach, installing cameras at intersections in order to use computer vision to detect, classify and warn of potential conflicts <span class="citation">(Zangenehpour, Miranda-Moreno, and Saunier <a href="#ref-zangenehpour_automated_2015">2015</a>)</span>. This work with video is challenging, however, “due to the constant change of orientation and appearance of pedestrians and cyclists”. The following proposal recommends another path, relying on less variable characteristics. After all, the objective is to find a solution that is inexpensive and effective enough to install widely - protecting the most people possible.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-data-science-of-smart-intersections" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> The Data Science of Smart Intersections</h2>
<p>The key to this project’s approach lies in the classification and characterization of roadway users according to mass (which, unlike physical appearance/orientation, does <em>not</em> change during traversal of a given intersection) and velocity (which can be expected to change only within predictable user-category bounds). The combination of mass and velocity is momentum - literally defined as mass in motion. Momentum is an especially appropriate factor for classification and prediction in a traffic risk-avoidance scenario because momentum is conserved in a collision: the wider the gap between two objects’ momentums, the more potential harm to the lower-momentum party.</p>
<p>For this pilot project, snapshots of momentum would be determined for each roadway user approaching an intersection via means of a series of inexpensive, weather-proof vibration-sensor packs, semi-permanently adhered to intersection surfaces (like curbing). Each individual sensor-pack would be a combination of <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/1739">piezoelectric elements</a> - converting various levels of vibration into various levels of voltage - and an array of <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/?q=vibration%20sensor%20switch">vibration sensor switches</a> - which either do or do not close a circuit, depending on the level of vibration impinging upon them. While pilot placement is envisioned along the vertical edges of curbing walls, it is not inconceivable that (in the absence of curbing) such components could be installed in ordinary roadway reflectors, expanding coverage to more of the population.</p>
<p>An intersection’s set of sensor-packs should be distributed every few meters along intersection approach paths (for instance, along each of 3 lanes in a “T”-shaped intersection). Wirelessly connections would communicate precise sensor-pack locations and vibration readings - all in real-time - to the smart intersection’s own network hub. This hub would itself be connected to the internet for monitoring, maintenance, and in case of emergency reporting, but note that no personally-identifiable information need be transmitted to the intersection’s hub (unlike with cameras).</p>
<p>Once a pilot intersection is set up to receive data from its sensor-packs, the Data Science team will supervise training of its software, so that the intersection can classify intersection users according to risk categories, identifying, for instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>a deer 🦌 vs.</li>
<li>a child on a scooter 🛴 vs.</li>
<li>a wheelchair user ♿ vs.</li>
<li>a bike commuter 🚴♀️ vs.</li>
<li>a giant delivery truck 🚚, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ground truth for any given intersection could be measured during normal or detoured-&amp;-artificially-controlled traffic flow. Community input and intersection-specific historical performance data can be used as well; for instance, a crossing near a school for the blind could include special tuning. Prior to “going live” with any given smart intersection, transportation safety staff could conduct a gauge repeatability and reproducibility study, logging the intersection’s new instrumented capabilities and/or any areas that may need improvement.</p>
<p>Once live, an intersection’s status (for instance, 2 cyclists approaching uphill, a delivery van barreling downhill, and a wheelchair user waiting behind a utility pole to enter the crosswalk) could be broadcast locally to a “See Around Corners” mobile app. Those wishing to make informed intersection traversals could simply download the app and activate voice warnings, hearing “Incoming downhill!” in any preferred language. Notice especially that anyone - not just drivers - could avail themselves of this foresight.</p>
<p>The fundamental research question then becomes: can machine learning be used to train a smart intersection to detect and classify roadway users, predicting potential paths with enough precision to warn users <em>before</em> a collision? If so, what level of false positives and false negatives should be expected and accepted? And then, what are the incentives that stakeholders - like local governments, parents, or insurers - can offer in order to encourage the public to tune into what smart intersections have to say?</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Self-Driving Cars to Co-Exist with Smart Intersections</h2>
<p>Autonomous cars are on the roads now <span class="citation">(Hersman and Lee <a href="#ref-hersman_reducing_2017">2017</a>)</span>, and this project takes no issue with their progress. When cars can keep other cars (and buses, and trains, etc.) informed about which resources are needed by whom and when, movements can be coordinated and accident rates should fall.</p>
<p>But mixed-mode transit is also here to stay, and therefore we can’t expect vehicles alone to carry all the burden of preventing roadway injury and death. There will always be other modes in play. Globally, some prefer not to own a vehicle, and some don’t have the means. Many embrace active modes of transportation, like walking and cycling. This shouldn’t relegate large swathes of the population to simply being labelled as “vulnerable roadway users” <span class="citation">(H Naci <a href="#ref-h__naci_distribution_2009">2009</a>)</span> to accommodate in a car company’s self-driving algorithm, if at all possible. Instead, we can be designing traffic safety solutions designed to fold in (but not rely only upon) autonomous vehicles. Every node - including smart, self-sensing intersections - in our transit grid can contribute. It’s time we smarten up our intersections so they can serve and protect everyone.</p>
